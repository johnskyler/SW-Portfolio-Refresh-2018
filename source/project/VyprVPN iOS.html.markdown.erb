Customer research on existing VyprVPN products indicated that users perceived the software as a simple switch for enabling or disabling connection security. These wireframes were early iterations around the idea that the whole application could function as that switch. Goals were to encourage adoption by promoting simplicity and ease of use by making the primary interaction simple and highly discoverable.
