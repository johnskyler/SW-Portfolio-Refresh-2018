I was contracted by Hammerquist Studios, a frequent collaborator of mine over the years, to spearhead a full UX re-work for a new client in the Seattle area, Fisheries Supply. Fisheries was a marine supplier who had built a loyal following over decades due to their excellent, expert service. Their extensive knowledge of marine supply had made them a central stop for everyone from hobbyists, to professional marine mechanics, to industrial shipyards. With an online catalog of more than a million items, as well as an extensive brick-and-mortar sales floor, Fisheries was looking for redesigning their online experience to meet the needs of all of their customers and employees.

In partnership with a brand strategist, I began by conducting an extensive review of their current customers. After compiling hours of interviews, on-site visits to customers, and recordings of user activity on the current site, we formulated a core set of customer personas, around which we would center the rest of our work.

With those personas in place, I worked with the Fisheries team to develop a feature list that would satisfy the diverse needs of their customers. With those features outlined, I wireframed a redesigned shopping experience from the ground up. Due to the deep, complex nature of their catalog, and the rich order tracking and management needed by their professional customers, this was a massive undertaking. In order to facilitate a more agile design process, we began testing individual chunks of the wireframes site before all design was complete. This allowed us to learn while the design was still in-progress and incorporate those learnings as we moved forward.  Full user testing and iteration also happened after wireframes were complete.

The Fisheries Supply site is currently in development, after being handed off entirely to the internal Fisheries Supply team.
